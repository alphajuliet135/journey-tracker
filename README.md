A small app to share your travel journey

## DB & API

The DB will be based on PostGreSQL and communication will be done via GraphQL.

- [ ] finish first version of DB Structure with the help of pg migrate

## Backend NodeJS (Backup) - current developing focus

If the go service should not run as wished or development takes much longer, I will proceed building the backend in NodeJS

- [ ] attach migrate process on first run of service
- [ ] make service runnable
- [ ] connect to database and retrieve first data
- [ ] implement graphql and create basic schema
- [ ] do first retrieval of data
- [ ] further proceed building the service (edit this task)
