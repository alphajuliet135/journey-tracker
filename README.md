# journey-tracker

A small app to share your travel journey

## DB & API

The DB will be based on PostGreSQL and communication will be done via GraphQL.

## Frontend

Frontend will be built in Angular. For statemanagemt (if needed), we will be using NgRx with Signals (Signal Store)

## Backend Go (Experimental)

My first go service.

## Backend NodeJS (Backup)

If the go service should not run as wished or development takes much longer, I will proceed building the backend in NodeJS
